The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used throughout the application files.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the `.tsx` files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of dependencies and scripts for the application. It is referenced by all other files that require external packages.

5. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for TypeScript. It is referenced by all `.tsx` files.

6. **_app.tsx**: This file is a custom App component. It initializes pages and will be used across all pages in the application.

7. **_document.tsx**: This file is a custom Document. It is used to augment the application's <html> and <body> tags, and is used across all pages in the application.

8. **index.tsx**: This is the main page of the application. It may contain shared components and logic used in other pages.

9. **globals.css**: This file contains global styles that are applied across all pages in the application.

10. **favicon.ico**: This is the website's favicon, which is displayed in the browser tab. It is used across all pages.

11. **.gitignore**: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It affects all files in the repository.

12. **README.md**: This file provides information about the project and its setup. It doesn't directly share dependencies with other files, but it may reference them.

Note: As the specific code is not provided, the exact names of exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names cannot be determined.
